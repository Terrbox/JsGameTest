# JsGameTest
Test game practice with Js and jQuery

## What's up for the moment
For the moment, i have done a red dot moving with the arrow keys. You can look at the code and tell if there is another way to do the same thing, and with the same "pseudo-animation" look. If you want to collaborate, send my one pull request and I'll look it. 

The project is in continuous developing.

There is a GitHub Page branch, with the following url: [https://terrbox.github.io/JsGameTest/](URL "GitHub Page")

At your service.
