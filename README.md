# JsGameTest
Test game practice with Js and jQuery

## What's up for the moment
For the moment, i have done a red dot moving with the arrow keys and shooting bullets with wasd. You can look at the code and tell if there is another way to do the same thing, and with the same "pseudo-animation" look. I have done it with the help of the intervals, I think this isn't a much efficient way... If you want to collaborate, send my one pull request and I'll look it. 

The project is in continuous developing.

There is a GitHub Page branch, with the following url: https://terrbox.github.io/JsGameTest/

At your service.
